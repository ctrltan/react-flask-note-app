# CI/CD for React-Flask Note-Taking App

This project was created to simulate interative development of a full-stack application, with the support of an automated CI/CD pipeline.

## Pipeline

* Unit tests are run on `git commit` using Github Actions
* When a feature is complete, a **Pull Request** is made to merge the branch with main
  * Triggers GitHub Actions unit test before merge
* Jenkins pulls code from GitHub on merge with main
  * Builds Docker image from source code
  * Unit and integration tests run using Docker Compose
  * Images pushed to Docker Hub if tests pass
* Deploy to Render (https://render.com/)
  * Render pulls Docker images from Docker Hub
  * Deploys application with new feature 


## How to Run

## Architecture

## Approach & What I've Learnt
**Database Management across Dev, Testing and Production Environments**

When developing locally, my approach was to create and delete a test table within a fixture for the backend unit tests. When implementing the first part of continuous integration with GitHub actions, I found that connecting to my locally hosted PostgreSQL DB would need to be set up in the GitHub actions virtual environment too.

My approach to this problem is to use a containerised PostgreSQL database with Docker for local development and testing (locally + GitHub): 
- This eliminates the need for dependency setup in both environments
- Easy to spin up the container and tear it down once tests are complete
- Simpler maintenance e.g. upgrading PostgreSQL in one place and not in each environment

âœ… Successful!
